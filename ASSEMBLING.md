# DotBot Assembling manual

This document will guide you through the DotBot assembling workflow.

## Material & Tools

Make sure you have all required [components](./COMPONENTS.md).

You will all also need access to a soldering station and an Allen screen
driver (1.5mm). A pair of precision pliers are also useful to insert the
threaded insert in the 3D printed parts, see below.

## Prepare the PCBs

2 things must be soldered manually on the main DotBot PCB:
- the battery holder. This one is pretty straight forward
- the 2 pins micro JST connectors for the left and right motors. **Be careful,
  they should be correctly oriented.**

Once the battery holder and the JST connectors are soldered, you should have the
following result:

## Prepare the 3D printed parts

The threaded inserts have to be inserted inside the 2 motor holders and inside
the ball caster holder. This is done using the tip of the soldering station:

A placed threaded insert looks like this:

Once done, the motor and ball caster holders look like this:
